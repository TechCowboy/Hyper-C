# Hyper C

HyperC is a program development system published by WSM Group Inc. and David B. McClain around 1985-1986 for 6502 and 65c02 Apple II computers.  The source files reflect the text and directory structure originally provided.  

The technical reference manual I obtained and scanned can be retrieved from https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/Apple%20II%20Documentation%20Project/Software/Languages/C/WSM%20Group%20HyperC/ as well as a few other archives.  The binaries have been archived at various ftp sites in the past and can be found by searching https://mirrors.apple2.org.za .  Various utilities and libraries may also be found there.  Apple IIgs users can use HC.SYSTEM by Gary Desrochers to run Hyper C on those machines.
